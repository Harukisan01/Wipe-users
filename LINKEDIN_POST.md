**🚀 Introducing Wipe User Tool V2: Secure Offboarding for Microsoft 365**

I'm excited to share a new open-source project designed to simplify and secure the user offboarding process in Microsoft 365 environments.

**Key Features:**

This tool offers three levels of operation to suit different needs and security requirements:

*   **Level 1: Local Execution** (Interactive) - Perfect for ad-hoc tasks. Run scripts directly from your machine with MFA support.
*   **Level 2: Automation** (Service Principal) - Ideal for CI/CD pipelines and Azure Automation runbooks. Streamline your processes efficiently.
*   **Level 3: Bank-Grade Protection** (FIDO2 Passkeys + Azure Key Vault) - The ultimate security level. Utilizes phishing-resistant FIDO2 authentication where the private key never leaves the Azure Key Vault HSM. Based on the robust security patterns by Nathan McNulty.

**🇪🇺 European Data Residency & Compliance Focus:**

We understand the critical importance of data sovereignty and GDPR compliance. This tool is configured by default to deploy resources in **West Europe**, ensuring that sensitive operations and key management remain within the EU boundary. It includes strict sanitization of logs and data handling to respect privacy standards.
